# calci2.0
Javascript calculator app.

This is a completely rewritten version of my original javascript calculator app. After reviewing Calio 1.0 I thought I would see how much better I could do now, 2 years after starting the original. It features far better error handling, is much more readable and file size is reduced by 40% (despite increased commments!). I also added a secondary display section to hold the last calculation and result for reference and a full reset option.
